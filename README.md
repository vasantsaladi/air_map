# Begone Spotted Lanternfly

## 🏆 Achievements

- **Winner**: Best Environmental & Sustainability Hack (Silver Prize) at &hacks 10

## 📖 Story & Inspiration

This project was inspired by the urgent need to raise public awareness about the Spotted Lanternfly, an invasive species from China and Vietnam, now spreading across the US East Coast. Its destructive feeding habits damage local flora, leading to significant agricultural and ecological impacts. Our team, driven by personal connections and diverse expertise in computer science, data science, chemistry, and biology, aimed to create a project that aligns with our skills and promotes positive social change through conservation awareness.

## 🎮 What It Does

The project features an educational game designed to engage users in learning about the Spotted Lanternfly (SLF) through an interactive experience. The game challenges players to squash as many bugs as possible, simulating the real-world challenge of managing invasive species. As the game progresses, the increasing difficulty mirrors the ecological impact of unchecked invasive species.

## 🛠️ How We Built It

- **Game Development**: Built using Python and the Pygame module. The game design was inspired by classic Flash games, with a focus on creating an engaging and educational experience.
- **Data Visualization**: Utilized Geopandas for data analysis and visualization, although this aspect faced challenges during development.

## 🚧 Challenges

- Learning new technologies like Pygame and Geopandas.
- Collaborating effectively within a newly formed team.
- Pivoting project focus from data analysis to game development due to time constraints.

## 🎉 Accomplishments

- Successfully learned and implemented Pygame for game development.
- Developed a cohesive team dynamic despite initial communication hurdles.
- Raised awareness about the ecological impact of invasive species.

## 📚 What We Learned

- The importance of flexibility and adaptability in project development.
- Key ecological concepts such as invasive species, trophic cascades, and habitat loss.

## 🔮 Future Plans

- Improve data visualizations and integrate them seamlessly with the game.
- Enhance the game's aesthetics and user experience.
- Develop additional mini-games focused on SLF management, such as egg removal and habitat impact simulations.
- Embed the game into a web platform for broader accessibility.
